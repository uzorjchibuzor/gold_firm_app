# A Management Portal for Secondary Schools

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version: 3.1.2

* System dependencies
** Rails version: 7.2.2.2

* Database creation
Simply clone the repository and run rails db:{create,migrate}


* How to run the test suite
The application uses RSpec. Run the rpsec command from the root folder.
* Disclaimer
This is still a work in progress and more changes should be expected as soon as I have the time to implement them. Any suggestions and contributions are welcome.
